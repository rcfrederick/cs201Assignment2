Tests for Assignment2

Step 1: Place the make test text into your makefile.
Step 2: Place the testingFiles folder into the same folder as your makefile.
Step 3: Run make test


Details about the tests
The makefile will run 60+ of my tests then it run all of the tests from submission0 that are accessable to us. 
After the test run it will check your files against Dr. Lusth's files first, then it will check against my files.
For my files it does seperate outputs and error so that they can be debugged seperately.
I define the error files are the ones that are supposed to go to stdout and not the fp which is another file.
